## <a name='overview'>Rules</a>

* I create a git repository named `myFTP` with GITHub Desktop
* I create a file called `.author` with my name:

```sh
{
    "firstname": "Fa誰za",
    "lastname": "AKABLI"
}
```
* I create a FTP server and a client. The client must handle commands.
* In a fristime I used FaZilla 
* I used Javascript

## <a name='overview'> Overview</a>

The purpose of this challenge is to create an FTP client and server.
I use the file RFC959 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc959/

The client must handle the following commands:

* `USER <username>`: check if the user exist
* `PASS <password>`: authenticate the user with a password
* `LIST`: list the current directory of the server
* `CWD <directory>`: change the current directory of the server
* `RETR <filename>`: transfer a copy of the file _FILE_ from the server to the client
* `STOR <filename>`: transfer a copy of the file _FILE_ from the client to the server
* `PWD`: display the name of the current directory of the server
* `HELP`: send helpful information to the client
* `QUIT`: close the connection and stop the program

#  USER 

```sh
const user = [
  { id: 1, username: "faiza", password: "faiza" }
]

export function verifUser(username) {
  let result = false;
  for (const users of user) {
      if(users.username == username)
          result = true;
  }
  return result;
};
export function verifUserExist(args) {
  let result = ''
  if(verifUser(args))
      result = "220 User exists. \r\n";
  else
      result = "530 User doesn't exists.\r\n";

      return result;
};
```
Test with true user

```sh
USER faiza
Message received: 220 User exists. 
```
Test with wrong user

```sh
USER Faiza
Message received: 530 User doesn't exists. 
```

# PASS

```sh
const user = [
  { id: 1, username: "faiza", password: "faiza" }
]

export function checkPassword (password) {
  let result = false;
  for (const user of user) {
      if(user.password == password)
          result = true;
  }
  return result;
};

export function VerifPasswordExist(args) {
  let result = ''
  if(checkPassword(args))
      result = "230 Password Authentication is successfull. \r\n";
  else
      result = "530 Wrong Password.\r\n";

      return result;
};
```
Test with true password

```sh
PASS faiza
Message received: 230 Password Authentication is successfull. 
```
Test with wrong password
```sh
PASS Faiza
Message received: 530 Wrong Password. 
```

# LIST

```sh
export function list(socket) {
    fs.readdir(process.cwd(), (err, files) => {
      let list="";
      files.forEach(file=>{list+=file+"\r\n"})
      socket.write(list)  
    })      
};
```
```sh

# CWD

````sh

      process.chdir(args[0]);
      socket.write(`250 New directory, ${process.cwd()} \r\n`);
    } catch(err) {
       socket.write(`non-existent file, try another path \r\n`);
       }
